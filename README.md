## ⚡ Firebase — Hosting & Analytics

This project uses Firebase for hosting (vethoi.web.app / vethoi.firebaseapp.com) and optional analytics.

Steps to setup and deploy to Firebase:

1. Install the Firebase SDK (we added it to `package.json` as `firebase`) and optionally the CLI:

```pwsh
npm install
npm install -g firebase-tools   # optional: for deploy via CLI
```

2. Initialize Firebase locally (choose the existing project `ivs-159a7` or the `vethoi` hosting site):

```pwsh
firebase login
firebase init hosting
# choose project -> ivs-159a7, set public directory to `dist`, and configure as a single-page app
```

3. Build and deploy (recommended: build into `dist`):

```pwsh
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting

To deploy specifically to the `vethoi` site (instead of the default site for your project), use:

```pwsh
firebase deploy --only hosting:vethoi
```

If `firebase.json` has `public: public`, you can copy `dist` contents into `public` before deploy. Example:

```pwsh
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force public
Copy-Item -Path dist -Destination public -Recurse
firebase deploy --only hosting
```
```

4. The app will be published to:

- https://vethoi.web.app
- https://vethoi.firebaseapp.com

Note: We added `src/firebase.ts` and `src/environments/firebaseConfig.ts` to initialize the Firebase app at runtime — this uses the modern modular Firebase SDK and safe-guards analytics initialization so it runs only in the browser.

## 🔐 Secrets & environment variables

To protect keys/secrets:

- Never commit `.env`, secret JSONs (service account files), or private keys to the repo. Add them to `.gitignore`.
- We include a `.env.example` in this repository to show which variables are required — copy it to `.env` and fill with real values.
- Example env variables you should set locally: `FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, and `ADMIN_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH`.

If you want to move firebase config into env vars, update `src/environments/firebaseConfig.ts` to read from env (or `import.meta.env` for Vite) and add your `.env` values to your local environment.

### Production-ready Authentication

- Configure Firebase Authentication providers you need (Email/Password, Phone, Google) in Firebase Console -> Authentication -> Sign-in methods.
- Use email verification and disable sign-ins for users who haven't verified (important for production security).
- Store admin and service account keys securely in your infrastructure (Cloud Secret Manager, Azure KeyVault, or GitHub Actions secrets). Do not check them into Git.
- We included a sample Cloud Function at `functions/index.js` — this shows how to set custom claims (roles) for users. Deploy it with `firebase deploy --only functions` and call it securely from a privileged admin account.
- Add Firestore security rules to restrict access. Example rule: `allow read: if request.auth != null` and role-based rules to only allow admin access for management collections.

### Steps to enable production auth and roles

1. Create service account for admin operations: `firebase login --no-localhost && firebase setup:emulators:auth` or download service account key from Firebase project settings.
2. Deploy `functions` folder to Cloud Functions: (needs Node env & `firebase-tools`)

```pwsh
cd functions
npm install
firebase deploy --only functions
```

3. From the Firebase Admin console or via cloud function `setCustomClaims`, mark the first user as `admin` and call `authService.setRole(uid, 'admin')` from a safe backend path.

4. In Firestore rules, secure the collections like `users`, `rides`, and `payments` with role checks.

For more best practices (2FA, session management, auditing, logging), put these behind server-side enforcement and not only client-side checks.
